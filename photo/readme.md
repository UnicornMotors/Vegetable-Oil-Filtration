Looks like a very large surface area! so efficient.
What type of filters do you use? Can you show me where to buy them?
Brian
Brian Morehouse
I have a whole box of one micron filters so you wouldnâ€™t have to buy them for a long time.

I've seen people filter WVO using burlap sack, on youtube. Looked very inexpensive! but messy. ðŸ˜‚

Oh yeah I wouldnâ€™t do that.  This will make the oil so clean you would be able to cook with it one more time.

I just towed a 2000 lb trailer with my gas truck, 500 miles over WV mountains. and got like 10 mpg. With biodiesel I can probably get under $1.5/gal and 17mpg so ~35 equivalent!
